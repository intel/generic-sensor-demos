## Getting Started

Make sure you have following dependencies installed:

 + [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
 + [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) ``` npm install -g polymer-cli ```
 + For deployment to Google App Engine, install [SDK for App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads).

## Install Bower dependencies

If you have polymer-cli installed, you should have bower module, if not, install bower Node.js module.
```
npm install -g bower
```

Install polymer components that are required for the project.

```
bower install
```

## Viewing Your Application

```
polymer serve
```

This will serve application locally. By default, port 8080 will be used (http://localhost:8080/).

## Building Your Application

```
polymer build
```

This will create a `build/` folder with `bundled/` and `unbundled/` sub-folders
containing a bundled (Vulcanized) and unbundled builds, both run through HTML,
CSS, and JS optimizers.

You can serve the built versions by giving `polymer serve` a folder to serve
from:

```
polymer serve build/bundled
```

## Deploying to App Engine

```
gcloud app deploy app.yaml -v VERSION --project PROJECT_NAME
```

 + VERSION should be the version of your application, if omitted, it will be autogenerated.
 + PROJECT_NAME should be the name of App Engine project.
